# Newton-Raphson-Method
A physics project combining theoretical derivations and Python computations to calculate Wien’s constant from Planck’s law.

# Wien's Displacement Law Derivation

This project derives Wien's displacement law from Planck's radiation law. It includes:
- A PDF report showing all derivations, equations, and plots.
- A Python script (Newton-Raphson.py) implementing the Newton-Raphson method to find x and calculate Wien's constant.
- A Jupyter Notebook file creating the plot shown in the report.

This demonstrates the combination of theoretical physics and computational methods.
